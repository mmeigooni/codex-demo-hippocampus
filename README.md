# Hippocampus

Hippocampus is a shared memory system for Codex teams.

## GitHub permissions
- OAuth runs in public-only mode.
- The app only lists public repositories.
- Private repository imports are blocked server-side.

## Build workflow
- Work ships in numbered waves.
- Every wave is implemented on a `codex/wXX-*` branch.
- Every wave has a docs pass recorded in `docs/waves/`.
- Every wave is merged via a merge commit and tagged.
