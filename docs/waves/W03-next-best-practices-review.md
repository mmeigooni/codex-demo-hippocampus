# Wave 03 Next.js Best-Practices Review

Skill source: /Users/frequency/.agents/skills/next-best-practices/SKILL.md

## Checks
- File conventions: App Router uses `app/layout.tsx` and `app/page.tsx` correctly.
- Metadata location: `metadata` exported from server component layout.
- RSC boundary: no async client component introduced in scaffold.
- Route handler conflicts: none introduced in this wave.
- Dark mode setup: class-based approach (`html.dark`) aligned with app shell goals.

## Outcome
No blocking Next.js best-practice violations found in WP-004 scope.
